This repository contains code for analysis of data collected from several sensors,
including a smart chair, EMG, GSR, eye tracker, heart rate monitor, mouse, keyboard, environmental data, etc.


Sensor data represent activity of participants playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for about 30 minutes each.
We present comprehensive data analysis in our papers [eSports Pro-Players Behavior During the Game Events: Statistical Analysis of Data Obtained Using the Smart Chair](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9060167/)
and 
[Understanding Cyber Athletes Behaviour Through a Smart Chair: CS:GO and Monolith Team Scenario](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8767295/).
